# SimpleFlight ✈️

**SimpleFlight** is a minimal Flask app designed to make it easier to send API calls to the Sabre BargainFinderMax API. This would be a great starting point for anyone who has to build a parser between their website and the sabre API.

 Sabre is a GDS so it should be more accurate, but I regularly found inacuracies to carrier websites. If you want to build into the sabre API's you can leave a comment here to get in touch and I can try to pass on any help I can.
